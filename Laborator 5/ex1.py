'''
a) Write a module named utils.py that contains one function called process_item. The function will have one parameter, x,
and will return the least prime number greater than x. When run, the module will request an input from the user, convert
it to a number and it will display the output of the process_item function.

b) Write a module named app.py. When this module is run, it will run in an infinite loop, waiting for inputs from the user.
The program will convert the input to a number and process it using the function process_item implented in utils.py.
You will have to import this function in your module. The program stops when the user enters the message "q".
